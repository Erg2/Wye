# Wye
Wye in-3d character implementation language
(currently only works on monitor, not in HMD)

# Engine requires at least one library and start object on command line.  Ex:
python WyeMain.py -l TestLib.py -o TestLib.TestLib.testObj -o TestLib.TestLib.testObj2

# PyInstaller dist - works
pyinstaller Wye_V0.9.exe.spec
